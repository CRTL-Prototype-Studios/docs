# owo-ui Components

### Why is this even a thing?
Well, I had originally used `owo-lib`'s `owo-ui` to make one of my mods, `Control-UI-Refactored`. During the time of
development, I had slowly discovered that the original documentation, `wispforest.io`, doesn't have a full and thorough
documentation of their `owo-ui`'s capabilities and features. Especially of their lack-of-descriptions-and-examples for
the **Code-Driven** method and **Data-Driven** method of making a UI using `owo-ui`.

### So, what exactly is this?
Seeing the issues I've described at the front, I've decided to write an even thorough documentation for `owo-ui` and its
components, with descriptions of their features in full, both **Code-Driven** and **Data-Driven**, and examples that
would be helpful in an actual use case. These docs aren't perfect, of course, but I deem it would help a lot of new
developers who is planning on using the `owo-lib` mod to make a Minecraft UI using `owo-ui` by letting them avoid common
or uncommon mistakes. These _"mistakes"_ are concluded via my own experiences as well as asking other and probing through
multiple GitHub repositories that has high-quality `owo-ui` code which achieved astonishing effects.
