Welcome to the Nexus documentation. This API provides endpoints for managing blog posts, comments, files, photos, and etc. It's designed to be used as a backend for a content management system.

The entire Nexus backend was written in Golang and [open-sourced](https://github.com/CRTL-Prototype-Studios/Nexus), so make sure to go drop an issue or star there!

Feedback and pull requests are also appreciated for Nexus.
